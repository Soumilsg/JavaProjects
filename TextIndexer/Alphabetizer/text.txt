The iPhone 11, which Apple announced in September 2019, is an impressive and relatively affordable handset with a fantastic camera and a fast processor. But those with an iPhone XS from 2018 may wonder if it's time for an upgrade. After all, the iPhone 11 has some great new hardware and a bevy of fun entici5ng color#s to choose from.
In short, the iPhone XS is still worth holding onto, and if you want an upgrade, I'd wait to see what the 2020 iPhone 12 has in store first, or consider the iPhone 11 Pro or Pro Max instead. But if it comes down to the iPhone XS or iPhone 11, the better choice is the iPhone 11. Note that while Apple discontinued the iPhone XS, you can still nab the device from various retailers and carriers.
Starting at $699, £729 and AU$1,199, the iPhone 11 is affordable as far as iPhones go. Despite its LCD screen not being as high-resolution as the iPhone XS' OLED display, the iPhone 11's updated camera setup includes Night Mode and an ultra wide-angle lens for dramatic, sweeping shots. The phone is also faster, has a longer-lasting battery and subtle upgrades like a U1 chip keep it in tip-top shape for the near future Read our Apple iPhone 11 review.
